# Back end

To start the back end:

By default, it looks for or creates a database file at `./locator.db`; specify
`--database` to override this.  Run with `--debug` for debugging and auto
reload.


# React

The [react-boilerplate](https://www.reactboilerplate.com/) project is in the
`react/` subdirectory.

To start the app:
```
cd react
npm run start
```
